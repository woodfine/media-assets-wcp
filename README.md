# media-assets-wcp | Media Assets Registry

## Overview
This repository serves as the centralized, authoritative source for institutional brand assets. This is a standalone repository, decoupled from the primary monorepo structure to ensure streamlined procurement and access for external design partners and specialized marketing workflows.

## Directory Structure
- **/branding**: Technical specifications, color matrices, and typographic standards.
- **/logos**: Master vector (.svg, .eps) and high-resolution raster (.png, .jpg) brand marks.
- **/guidelines**: Comprehensive brand identity documentation and usage manuals.

## Usage
Assets must be sourced directly from this registry to ensure compliance with the latest institutional standards. Adherence to the specifications in the `/branding` directory is mandatory for all production materials.
