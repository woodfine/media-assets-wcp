# Repository Architecture: media-assets-wcp

This document defines the structural hierarchy and governance of the standalone asset registry.

## Core Directories

### 1. /branding
- **specs/**: Technical definitions (e.g., `COLORS.md`) for institutional identity.
- **palettes/**: Software-specific color files for design suites.

### 2. /logos
- **/primary**: Master corporate marks in all approved formats.
- **/secondary**: Derivative marks for specific sub-brands or departments.
- **/monochrome**: Simplified variants optimized for single-color print or etched production.

### 3. /guidelines
- High-fidelity brand books and quick-reference digital implementation manuals.

## Maintenance and Governance
To ensure brand integrity, this repository is maintained independently of the software monorepo. All modifications to the core identity assets must undergo a formal review process.
